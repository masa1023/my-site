# ScholarAgent: Making Machine Learning Research Accessible with Generative AI

## Introduction

Understanding complex machine learning research papers can be daunting, especially for learners without a strong academic background. _ScholarAgent_ bridges this gap by enabling users to ask questions about the seminal paper _“Attention Is All You Need”_ and receive clear, conversational answers powered by Generative AI.

This blogpost explores how ScholarAgent leverages cutting-edge Gen AI capabilities to simplify dense academic content, making it accessible to students, developers, and enthusiasts alike.

## The Problem: Accessibility of Research Papers

Machine learning research papers are often written in dense, technical language, making them inaccessible to many learners. This creates a barrier to understanding foundational concepts like the Transformer architecture introduced in _“Attention Is All You Need”_.

### How ScholarAgent Solves This Problem

ScholarAgent uses Generative AI to break down complex content into digestible insights. By combining **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, **vector search**, and **agent orchestration**, ScholarAgent provides an interactive way to explore and understand research papers.

## Key Features and Implementation

### 1. Document Processing with Google Gen AI Embedding Model

ScholarAgent processes the research paper by embedding its content using Google's Gen AI Embedding model. The embeddings are stored in **ChromaDB**, a vector database optimized for fast and accurate searches.

```python
# Embed the document using Gemini and store in ChromaDB
from chromadb import Documents, EmbeddingFunction

class GeminiEmbeddingFunction(EmbeddingFunction):
    def __call__(self, input: Documents):
        response = client.models.embed_content(
            model="models/text-embedding-004",
            contents=input,
        )
        return [e.values for e in response.embeddings]

db.add(documents=chunked_documents, ids=[str(i) for i in range(len(chunked_documents))])
```

### 2. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

When a user asks a question, ScholarAgent retrieves the most relevant chunks of the paper from ChromaDB. These chunks are then used as context for generating a natural language response.

```python
# Query the vector database for relevant chunks
result = db.query(query_texts=["What is a Transformer?"], n_results=3)
retrieved_chunks = result["documents"]
```

### 3. Response Generation with Gemini 2.0 Flash

The retrieved context is passed to **Gemini 2.0 Flash**, which generates a conversational response tailored to the user's query.

```python
# Generate a response using Gemini 2.0 Flash
response = llm.invoke([retrieved_chunks])
print(response.content)
```

### 4. Agent-Orchestrated Function Calling with LangGraph

ScholarAgent uses **LangGraph** to orchestrate complex workflows, such as rephrasing queries or chaining multiple steps. This ensures a seamless user experience.

```python
# Define a chatbot node with tools
def chatbot_node_with_tools(state):
    new_output = llm_with_tools.invoke([state["messages"]])
    return {"messages": [new_output]}
```

## Results and Impact

ScholarAgent demonstrates the following Generative AI capabilities:

- **Document Understanding**: Embedding and processing dense academic content.
- **RAG**: Retrieving relevant information to answer user queries.
- **Agent Orchestration**: Managing complex workflows for enhanced interactivity.

By making research papers accessible, ScholarAgent empowers learners to explore advanced concepts like the Transformer architecture interactively.

## Limitations and Future Directions

### Current Limitations

1. **Domain-Specific Knowledge**: The model's understanding is limited to the embedded content.
2. **Scalability**: Processing large documents can be resource-intensive.
3. **Contextual Understanding**: Responses may lack depth for highly nuanced questions.

### Future Improvements

1. **Multi-Paper Support**: Extend ScholarAgent to handle multiple research papers.
2. **Enhanced Contextual Awareness**: Improve response quality by integrating external knowledge sources.
3. **Interactive Visualizations**: Add diagrams and flowcharts to explain complex concepts.
